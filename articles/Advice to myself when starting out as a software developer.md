# Advice to myself when starting out as a software developer

All the habits help one to grow faster and in a more focused way.

## Take the time to read two books per year on software engineering

1. taking chapters through with others
2. taking notes
3. doodle diagrams
4. trying out and going back and re-reading

a book which is on a specific technology, or on software engineering practices

I do it rather slowly. I usually go a chapter or two in one sitting. I take notes or do highlights.

When I 'm done, I then recap and often discuss with others



## Learn the language you use at work in-depth, to the very bottom

the more languages you know, the more you can evaluate their strengths and weaknesses

## Pair with other developers more often

## write unit tests and run them against a CI

## make refactoring a habit and master refactoring tools

I realized I was afraid of refactoring as I missed both the practice and the tools to do this well.

## know that good software engineering is experience. Get lots of it.

Look for opportunities to work on different stacks, different domains, and challenging projects.

## Teach what you learn.
